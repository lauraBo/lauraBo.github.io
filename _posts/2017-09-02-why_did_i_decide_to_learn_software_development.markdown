"#Why did I decide to learn software development?"  I have long wanted to learn how to code but never had the confidence to start.  `` I first became actively interested in coding when my younger brother founded his own company called Digital Butter in Hong Kong specialising in web design, web development and online marketing and I always take the chance to learn more about his projects whenever I see him. I had to create my own websites for my own stand up and voiceover work, which I did using Wix, and I was desperate to know how to do it properly. While I greatly enjoyed creating them, I know many in the arts who would love help in building their own websites, and I would love to set up my own company specializing in websites and apps for performers, in order to be able to help them. 

I also have a passion for dogs and have volunteered at shelters since I was a teenager. I'd love to build apps that helped pet owners find products, services and pet-friendly locations that are more user-friendly than those that currently exist.

.....and  I would love to see my brother's face when I tell him I can code! He has never said it, but I don't think he believes I will be able to do it! -
